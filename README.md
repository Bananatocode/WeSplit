      WeSplit is a simple yet practical application designed to make group outings easier by calculating tips based on the total bill and party size. This app serves as an efficient tool to quickly figure out how much each person needs to pay, including their share of the tip. WeSplit was developed as a part of my learning journey through the "100 Days of SwiftUI" course.

## Key Features
- **Tip Calculator:** Enter the total bill amount, select the tip percentage, and specify the number of people in the party to calculate each person's share.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to input data and view calculated results.
- **Adaptable for Various Group Sizes:** Whether dining with a small group or a larger party, WeSplit scales smoothly to handle different group sizes.

## What I Learned
- **SwiftUI View Protocol:** All SwiftUI views must conform to the View protocol, which includes at least one computed property, the `body`.
- **State Management:** Utilized `@State` property wrapper to manage state changes within the app. When a `@State` property changes, SwiftUI reinvokes the `body` property to update the view.
- **Form and Navigation:** Learned to use Forms for input fields and NavigationView to enhance the user experience with navigational capabilities.
- **Data Binding:** Implemented two-way binding using `$` notation to bind UI elements to underlying data for real-time updates.
- **User Input Handling:** Explored different keyboard types and managed user input effectively.
- **Picker and Section Styling:** Gained experience in customizing Picker views and using Sections to organize content within the Form.
- **Formatting Output:** Applied C-style format strings for precise control over the display of floating-point numbers.

## Reflections
Developing WeSplit marked the beginning of my journey through the "100 Days of SwiftUI" course. As my first project in this series, it laid a strong foundation in understanding the core aspects of SwiftUI. It taught me essential skills such as managing state with `@State`, handling user input, and effectively organizing UI elements with Forms and Sections.
This project was a valuable stepping stone in my iOS development path. It helped me grasp the basics of SwiftUI and its application in creating practical, user-centric interfaces.
